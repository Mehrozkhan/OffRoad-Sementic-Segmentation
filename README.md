# OffRoad-Sementic-Segmentation


This is my first attempt to any deep learning task. I tried to make this work and I learnt a lot of new tools like pytorch, tqdm, albumentations. I used transfer learning for UNET with resent34 as my base model. Tried various combinations of weight decay, learning rates and epochs. The main matric to determine performance was mIoU and for test data, it was around 0.7.
